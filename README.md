# Homographies-Condensation_Machine_Vision

Part 1 - A) Implementation of homography and DLT (Direct Linear Transform Algorithm)
Part 1 - B) Using the DLT algorithm to produce a panoramic image by mapping three separate images together

## 07_Pratical_Homographies: ##

* Part 1:
  * Pratical1 - implementation of the DLT (Direct Linear Transform Algorithm) that calculated the homography that best maps two sets of points to one another.
  * Pratica1B - Using homography routine implemented to make a panorama of several images that are related by a homography.

* Part 2
  * Pratical2 - Exploring the geometry of a single camera. The aim is to take several points on a plane, and predict where they will appear in the camera image. Based on these observed points, I then try to re-estimate the Euclidean transformation relating the plane and
the camera. 
  * Pratical2b - Using the routines already implemented to draw a wireframe cube on an augmented reality marker (black square). I need to combine tracking and homographies to first track the vertices of a black square from a moving camera and second produce an augmented cube on top of the square.

## 09_Pratical_Condensation: ##

* Pratical9a - Implementation of condensation algorithm using Brownian motion model
* Pratical9b - Using condensation algorithm to track a given shape (a silver car) as it moves in a sequence of frames. The shape/appearance model is trivial: just a template which is given.

##  HW2: ##

* HW2_Practical9c - Using particle filters to track each of the 4 vertices of the black square.
* HW2_TrackingAndHomographies - Combining tracking and homographies to first track vertices of a black square from a moving camera and second produce augmented cube on top of the square.
